# HIV-1_VBOF-FBA
## VBOFKit
These are the Python functions used for the HIV-1 generation (Also could be used for generating VBOF of viruses).
#### Requirements
* Viranet: https://github.com/seanaller/viranet
* Cobrapy: https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/
## Host-virus-model
Genome-scale models (GEMs) of 4 CD4+ T cells generated by Puniya et al. were acquired from [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), under the acession number MODEL1909260003, MODEL1909260004, MODEL1909260005, MODEL1909260006.
Models integrated with HIV-1 VBOF were deposited in the host-virus-model folder and used for analysis
## Analysis codes
All the analyses were conducted using the IDE Jupyter Notebook and the codes were uploaded in the .ipynb file.
## Publication
This work is published @ [*Infectious Diseases & Immunity*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ID9.0000000000000109)
